# retro-bits

You can see the page here: https://kboeh.github.io/retro-bits/

I originally created this a few months ago and decided to update it using what I have learned since then.
This was the first page I created using grid and with a nav button that can be toggled.
I tested the site's functionality and design within smaller phone sizes (Galaxy S5) all the way up to desktop.
I experimented making elements stack, or dissapear, etc. when the window is resized.
Also, I wanted to see if making the nav take up the whole screen on toggle would work.
There are some design elements I will never do again, but I learned allot (and had fun in the process).
I gave the page an 8-bit old-school Nintendo feel and linked (almost everything) to relevant sites (**which are not of my creation**).
