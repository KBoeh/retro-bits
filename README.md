# retro-bits

Retro-Bits was a practice page I not only learned much from but enjoyed making. I experimented making elements stack or disappear at different screen sizes using CSS Grid. Using JavaScript I wrote an on-click event listener that toggles my navigation drop down menu, scrolls to the top of the page, and then disables scrolling.

I tested the site's functionality and design within smaller phone sizes all the way up to desktop. I gave the page an 8-bit old-school Nintendo feel and linked almost everything to relevant sites. Fun!
